the first solution decomposes the problem according to the four basic functions performed input shift alphabetize
and output these computational components are coordinated as subroutines by a main program that sequences through
them in turn data is communicated between the components through shared storage core storage communication between
the computational components and the shared data is an unconstrained read write protocol this is made possible by the
fact that the coordinating program guarantees sequential access to the data
